# Bitmoji IOS Sample App

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you are using XCode 9.0+

The sample app uses Cocoapods to build dependencies. To get started, run

```
pod install
```

### Set up

Add the client id and redirect in the [Info.plist](https://github.com/Snap-Kit/bitmoji-sample/blob/master/ios/BitmojiSampleApp/Supporting%20Files/Info.plist) file (See `CFBundleURLSchemes`, `SCSDKClientId` and `SCSDKRedirectUrl`).

Add the frameworks you received under [BitmojiSampleApp/Frameworks](https://github.com/Snap-Kit/bitmoji-sample/tree/master/ios/BitmojiSampleApp/Frameworks).

Import `BitmojiSampleApp.xcodeproj` and start building!
